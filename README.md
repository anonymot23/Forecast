# Forecast

This repository aims at using some recent machine learning methods to solve a forecasting problem. For each model implemented, we try to follow the three steps below

- [Data preparation:](#pre-processing) Inputs are pre-processed, normalized and key features extracted
- [Model training:](#training) Model implementation and parameters' fitting
- [Evaluation:](#evaluation-to-ensure-satisfactory-model-performance)  Model testing to ensure satisfactory model performance 


## Quick Start

Use the commands below to run the code 
```
# Prepare environment
git clone https://github.com/anonymot23/Forecast.git
cd Forecast

# Sample model run
python tests.BASELINE.test_baseline_simple
```
